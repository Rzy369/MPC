# Model Predictive Control Project (SC42125)

## Objective
Motivated by the challenges of needle insertion in medical procedures, this project aims to develop a model predictive control method based on a bevel-tip needle model to achieve accurate path tracking.

## Labour distribution

The added functionalities by us are:

- Needle dynamics and simplification
- Linear MPC and adaptive MPC design
- Proof of stability
- numerical simulations

For more details, please refer to our [report](https://github.com/Rzy369/MPC/blob/main/report.pdf).

## Dependencies

numpy, matplotlib, CVXPY

## To run our code

```
git clone git@github.com:Rzy369/MPC.git
cd MPC
python main.py
```
